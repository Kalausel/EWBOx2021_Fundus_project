# EWBOx2021_Fundus_project

This is the code I wrote for my project with "Engineers without borders Oxford", which is part of an extracurricular course in machine learning.
The model's task is categorising images of the fundus (the back surface of the eye) into one or more of 8 categories of diseases.
The images and the model's parameters are too large to upload here.
